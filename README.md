# sfuller-dotfiles
A collection of configuration files for various programs and utilities. These dotfiles are platform agnostic. (if they aren't, please create an issue)

## Usage
I recomend cloning this repository somwhere (like `~/.dotfiles`) and then symlinking the dotfiles to the correct locations.

## Todo
* Allow dotfiles to be easily tweakable without editing the main dotfile

## OMG THESE DOTFILES SUCK
I welcome all feedback and pull requests to help make these dotfiles more kickass.
